==========

Data-driven is a jQuery UI override (see 'Duck Punch' or 'Monkey Patch') that extends the options of jQuery UI widgets to your HTML via the HTML5 data attribute. Options can be initiliazed/setup once in your JS file and can then be defined/overridden in your mark-up on an individual basis, per each widget.
